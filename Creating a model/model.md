##  **Chat GPT Question 02:**

Remember her name as Emma Fernando.

I need to tell gemini the same.

Next I need her to wear a black tshirt and denim and shoe which would be
perfect for model selection. Like imagine a real life photshoot. Before
we recruit the model we have to like have to look at her and understand
the features of her right. I need you to create a prompt which helps us
to create turnaround images which will help us to make a decision to
select her as our model.

I already gave gemini the prev prompt so we dont have to give features
again.

**Answer:**

Understood 👍  
Since **Gemini already has her features**, this prompt will **reference
Emma Fernando by name**, focus on **model-selection turnarounds**, and
feel like a **real-life casting / test shoot**, without re-describing
her face.

You can paste this directly after your previous prompt.

### **🎯 Gemini Prompt -- Model Selection Turnaround (Emma Fernando)**

> Use the previously defined character **Emma Fernando**.
>
> Create a **professional model-selection test photoshoot** of Emma
> Fernando, designed for **casting and recruitment evaluation**.
>
> She is wearing a **simple black fitted T-shirt**, **classic blue denim
> jeans**, and **clean neutral shoes** suitable for a real-world
> modeling audition. Outfit should be minimal and realistic, allowing
> clear visibility of body proportions and posture.
>
> Scene is a **professional studio casting setup**, neutral background,
> no props, no distractions --- similar to a **fashion agency test
> shoot**.
>
> Generate **full-body turnaround images** showing:
> - Front view (neutral stance)
>- 3/4 angle (left and right)
>- Side profile
>- Back view
>
> Emma's **pose should be natural and confident**, relaxed shoulders,
> straight posture, professional model presence. Expression remains
> **neutral and composed**, suitable for evaluating facial structure and
> versatility.
>
> Lighting is **soft, even studio lighting** optimized to clearly show
> **facial structure, body proportions, and natural skin texture**
> without dramatic shadows.
>
> Camera style: **DSLR fashion test shoot**, eye-level camera, realistic
> focal length, accurate anatomy, consistent face and body across all
> views.
>
> The final result should look like **real casting photos taken before
> selecting a model**, not stylized, not cinematic, not editorial ---
> purely **professional, realistic, and evaluative**.

### **💡 Pro Tip (optional to add at the end)** 

If Gemini supports negatives, add:

 *no stylization, no exaggerated poses, no fashion effects, no AI-art
look*

If you want next, I can:

- Create a **separate prompt for facial-only turnarounds**

- Create a **runway walk reference pose set**

- Prepare a **model portfolio prompt** after selection

- Optimize this specifically for **Gemini consistency across generations**

Just say the word 👌

## **ChatGPT Question 03:**

I will upload an image of a frock to gemini. I need u to create a prompt
which tells gemini to understand the key features of the frock and make
Emma Fernando wear it.

## **Answer:-**

Perfect --- this is a **reference-based outfit transfer** use case.  
Since Gemini will *see the frock image*, the prompt should clearly tell
it **what to analyze**, **what to preserve**, and **what not to
change**, while keeping **Emma Fernando consistent**.

Below is a **precise, casting-quality prompt** you can paste **after
uploading the frock image**.

### **👗 Gemini Prompt -- Dress Reference → Emma Fernando** 

> Analyze the **uploaded frock image** and carefully understand its
> **key design features**, including:
> - overall silhouette and fit
>- fabric type and texture
>- color and color tone
>- neckline and sleeve design
>- length, cut, and flow
>- any patterns, seams, pleats, or detailing
>
> Using the **same character Emma Fernando** defined earlier, generate
> **ultra-realistic studio photographs** of Emma Fernando **wearing this
> exact frock**, preserving the dress design accurately without
> modification or stylization.
>
> The frock should fit naturally on her body, following realistic
> tailoring and fabric behavior, as if worn in a **real professional
> fashion photoshoot**.
>
> Maintain **Emma Fernando's facial identity, body proportions,
> hairstyle, and makeup exactly the same** as previously established. Do
> not alter her features.
>
> Scene: **professional studio**, neutral background, no props.
>
> Camera framing:
>- Full-body front view
>- 3/4 angle
>- Side profile
>- Back view
>- 
> Lighting: **soft, even studio lighting** that clearly shows the
> **dress structure, fit, and fabric texture**.
>
> Style: **DSLR fashion test shoot**, photorealistic, accurate anatomy,
> realistic skin texture, consistent face and body across all angles.
>
> The result should look like **a real model wearing the actual frock
> for evaluation**, suitable for **design review and model selection**,
> not artistic or editorial.

### **🔍 Optional line (recommended if Gemini supports it)** 

Add at the end:

> *no redesign, no color change, no added accessories, no AI-art look*

If you want, next I can:

- Create a **side-by-side prompt** (frock alone vs Emma wearing it)

- Add a **runway pose version**

- Make a **catalog / e-commerce style prompt**

- Optimize this for **maximum outfit accuracy**

Just tell me 👍

ChatGPT Question 04:

I need to create 10 different model shooting pics of emma.

the intention is to display what emma can do.

first give me 3 seperate prompts which will instruct gemini seperately.
Make sure we need to diversify. Like add accessories like handbags,
sunglasses etc. Also make sure we have different outfits also different
poses. You can also add props like her sitting on chairs, a stool, maybe
a box etc.

After you give me 3, i will test them first and if I like give me the
rest accordingly. The dimensions are 4:5 ratio, and each photo must
contain only 01 single pose
